## Description

#### When

This is my **first project** ever in programing. I discover programming in** 2007 in high school** during a history class. My friend had some program on his Casio calculator, and I read through the code and tried to reproduce them on mine. That was a lot of fun but I was quickly limited by the device and its language. 

That’s when I decided to learn programing on computer. I found some tutorial for C on the internet and so my programing journey started. 

#### What

As soon as I finished the tutorials, I wanted to try to program a full game. Among all the “simple” game I have in mind, I chose **the Tetris**. It was a good way too test all the things I had learn with these tutorials, a quite fun too.

#### How

This project was developed in **C** using the **SLD library**. SDL is quite a complete library which can perform all that is needed in a game, and it was part of the tutorial so it was quite an obvious choice. I didn’t use a version control at the time, and was developing on **DevC++**.

#### Note

As it was my first program, it’s of course full of terrible mistakes like memory loss (plus freeing local variables…) or awful design. Nonetheless the program is fully finished with highscore, option and even a graphical theme XD
